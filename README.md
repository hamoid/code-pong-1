code-pong-1
===========

Coding game. Two people. Processing. First try.

As for the game: yes, that sounds cool :)

## Rules

Clone the repo, edit max 5 lines (Example: add 2 lines, edit 2 lines, delete 1 line), push changes, wait for your turn, repeat :)

## To be figured out

* How do you know when it's your turn? Maybe at the top of the file we have a comment mentioning whose turn it is? So if I edit, I add you as next editor. Then more than 2 people could play.
* Do comments compute as changed lines?
