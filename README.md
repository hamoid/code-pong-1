code-pong-1
===========

Coding game. Two people. Processing. First try.

> I was wondering if you would like to play some kind of code game. It
> could be called code-pong :) You write 5 lines of code and send it by
> e-mail. I write or change 5 lines of code, send it back, and so on :)
> Like a chess game. First it will be something really simple. But with
> time it can become something complex and interesting. Or not :)
>
> Git would be perfect for this, because it keeps the full history of
> changes, and one can see the whole process from the beginning. It also
> shows you how many lines you changed, so you don't go past the limit of
> 5 :) Would you like to try?

As for the game: yes, that sounds cool :)
